It allows users to plan their meals in a week and then generate a grocery list based on the recipes in the recipe library.
Users can view recipe info in the recipe library or add their own recipes to the user recipe library.

Run the MainGUI in the package MainGUI, click the carrot button to enter.

"Explore" button allows users to view recipes in either the default library (which has recipes that come with the app),
or the user library (where users store their recipes). Users can add a new recipe by clicking the "add a new recipe"
button in either library. When adding a new recipe, users can hit the "+" in the Ingredient and Procedure tab to add
a new Ingredient/Procedure slot. (The "+" in Procedure tab is not well-implemented lol) When all the JTextFields have
input, users can click on the "Preview" button and then the recipe will be saved to the user library when "Save" button
is clicked.

"Plan" button allows users to view their previous plans and add a new plan. Users can view on the grocery list of a plan
by clicking "Grocery" button.
